Requirements
------------
1. Python 3 installed.
2. You can run Python 3 scripts.

Let's assume that your TiddlyWiki kept in file named mywiki.html. 

Put the file mimiserver.py to the same directory with that file and run it (depends on your OS). Than navigate to http://localhost:9889/mywiki.html. On Linux and Mac OS you may need to fix executable flag:

    chmod +x mimiserver.py

    ./mimiserver.py 4242

 To run it at port 4242. Choose your favourite number.

Open mimiserver.py in your text editor. There are some configuration variables on top. Edit them to suit your needs.
